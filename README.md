# ADM_HW5
This repository contains the Homework 5 of the Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining course. Following, you can find the description of the files contained in this repo:
* Part_1.ipynb: contains the code to merge the three datasets into one single graph. 
* main5.ipynb: contains the code needed to run Functionality 1, 2, 3, 4 and the algorithmic question. In the case of the three functionalities, you can also find their visualization in here. 
* support_functions4.py: contains the functions needed to run the Functionality 4 - Disconnecting graphs.
* utilities.py: contains the functions needed to run the Functionality 2 - Finding the best users. 
* images : a dir containing some plots for functionality 2.
* Functionality dirs : contains the code for func 1, 2, 3 separated. In particular in Func 2 dir there is a betweeness example for a graph bigger then the one tested in main5.ipynb ( that took long to be computed).
